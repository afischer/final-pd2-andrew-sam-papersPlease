#Papers, Please
*A final Project for APCS-Z*

### Project Contributers
- Andrew Fischer
- Sam Kim


### Compiling from Source
To compile the game, simply `git clone` the repo. Jump into a terminal, `cd` into the `src` directory, and run `javac *.java` to compile the program.
This may take a few moments, as there are quite a few classes.

Once compiled, run the program using the command `java Driver`. A java gui applet should open - do not close this for the duration of the program. It is used in conjunction with the terminal for gameplay.


### Gameplay
Gameplay is fairly streightfoward. All commands are issued through a terminal window in response to prompts. GUI windows give additional information and display the papers and rulebook.

### Rules
Papers, Please takes place in a fictional dystopian world, in 1982. The permise of the game is that you are an inspector working at a new checkpoint at the border of Arstotzksa. As the story develops, you realize the corruption of your government, the worries of the citizens, and even an underground organization.

Rules change dynamically as the days progress. Be sure to check the rulebook for new rules each day.
