You are the best.
I will never forget you.
Thanks, inspector.
Have a good one.
Like I want to be in this country anyway.
Finally, out of this line.
Thank you so much, inspector.
Hopefully this better than Impor.
Finally, away from dirty streets.
Bright city awaits!
This is great!
I'm so excited.
Wow. Arstoksa is a dump.
I can't believe I waited in line for 6 hours.
Great. I'm starving.
I guess I'll just drive my limo out of here... Heh?
Hmm. Thanks.
Yeah. Thanks.
I know. Thanks.
Yep. I'll be going.
My spouse is coming through later - you let her through too?
My son will be here soon, let him through!
